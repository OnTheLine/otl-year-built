  <p>Source: Parcel data provided by Town of Hamden. "Year built" shows only the most recent year of construction for current buildings, which is missing for about 7% of parcels, and does not show original dates for buildings torn down and replaced. Map developed by Jack Dougherty (Trinity College CT) and Ilya Ilyankou (Picturedigits). View <a href="http://github.com/ontheline/otl-year-built/">data and code on GitHub</a>.
