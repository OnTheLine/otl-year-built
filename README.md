## Goal
I am requesting a GIS shapefile of West Hartford property parcels with these data fields:

- parcel ID
- location (street address)
- year built

With this data, we will build an open-access interactive map that displays the history of residential property development in West Hartford, with credit to the Town as the data source, and we will freely share our map with the others on the On The Line site.
