  <p>This interactive map of property development in suburban West Hartford shows two key periods of activity. The 1920s construction boom on the east side and town center filled up 15 percent of all parcels available today, and 1950s growth on the north, west, and south sides filled up 31 percent of all parcels. Also, the total land area of developed property increased more sharply during the 1950s (24 percent of all available acres) compared to the 1920s (6 percent), when parcel sizes tended to be smaller. By the late 1960s, the town was almost entirely built out. Note that "year built" means the most recent year of construction recorded in the property assessment data, provided by Town of West Hartford and AppGeo, which was missing for about 3 percent of nearly 20,000 parcels and not shown here. Map developed by Jack Dougherty (Trinity College CT) and Ilya Ilyankou (Picturedigits). View <a href="http://github.com/ontheline/otl-zoning-west-hartford/">sources and code on GitHub</a>.
